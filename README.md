A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that wraps the Gemini CLI, allowing AI assistants like Claude to use Gemini for research and analysis tasks.

> **Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial, community-developed tool that wraps the Google Gemini CLI. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google. All Google and Gemini trademarks, service marks, and logos are the property of Google LLC. This project is licensed under the MIT License.

> **Important**: This tool requires that you have the Gemini CLI installed and authenticated on your system. See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for details.

## Features

- **gemini_prompt**: Send prompts to Gemini and get responses
- **gemini_research**: Research topics with optional file context and **web search grounding enabled by default**
- **gemini_analyze_code**: Analyze code files for reviews, explanations, optimizations, security, or testing
- **gemini_summarize**: Summarize content from text or files

### Advanced Features

- **Custom System Instructions**: All tools support custom system instructions to guide the model's behavior and response style
- **Web Search Grounding**: The research tool includes web search grounding by default to provide up-to-date information from the internet
- **Flexible Configuration**: System instructions and grounding can be controlled per-request to match your specific needs

## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Install from GitHub (latest)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp gemini-mcp

# Or from PyPI (when published)
uvx gemini-mcp
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp
cd gemini-cli-mcp
uv sync
uv run gemini-mcp
```

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python 3.10-3.13
Ensure you have Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 installed. The project is tested on all these versions.

### 2. Gemini CLI Installation and Authentication

This MCP server requires the Gemini CLI to be installed and authenticated:

1. **Install Gemini CLI**: Follow the official installation instructions for your platform
2. **Authenticate**: Run `gemini auth login` and follow the prompts
3. **Verify**: Test that it works by running `gemini -p "Hello, world!"`

If you see an authentication error, make sure you've completed the login process.

### 3. MCP-compatible Client
You'll need an MCP-compatible client such as:
- Claude Desktop
- Other MCP-compatible AI assistants

## Usage

### First Time Setup

Before running the server, verify your setup:

```bash
# Check if everything is configured correctly
gemini-mcp setup
```

This will check:
- Gemini CLI installation
- Authentication status
- Environment configuration

If you see authentication errors, run:
```bash
gemini auth login
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Method 1: Run from current directory (for development)
uv run gemini-mcp

# Method 2: Run using uvx from GitHub
uvx --from git+https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp gemini-mcp

# Method 3: Run if installed globally
gemini-mcp

# With debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG gemini-mcp
```

### Configuring with Claude Code (CLI)

#### Method 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install from GitHub (use -- separator for proper argument parsing)
claude mcp add gemini uvx -- --from git+https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp.git gemini-mcp

# Or install from PyPI when published
claude mcp add gemini uvx -- gemini-mcp
```

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration

Add this to `~/.config/claude-code/mcp-settings.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp.git", "gemini-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring with Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/DiversioTeam/gemini-cli-mcp.git", "gemini-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

This MCP server implements several security measures:

### File Access Control
- **Sandboxed file access**: By default, file access is restricted to the current working directory
- **Path validation**: All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Configurable allowed directories**: You can specify allowed directories via:
  - Constructor parameter: `GeminiMCPServer(allowed_directories=["/path/to/safe/dir"])`
  - Environment variable: `GEMINI_MCP_ALLOWED_DIRS=/path1:/path2:/path3`

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are properly sanitized before being passed to the CLI
- Command injection is prevented by using subprocess with argument lists (never shell=True)
- File paths are resolved and validated before use

### Best Practices
- Always run the server with minimal required permissions
- Regularly update both the MCP server and Gemini CLI
- Monitor logs for any suspicious activity

## Development

### Setting up the Development Environment

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics

Run the setup check to diagnose common issues:
```bash
gemini-mcp setup
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Gemini CLI not found in PATH"**
   - Ensure Gemini CLI is installed: `which gemini`
   - Add Gemini to your PATH if needed
   - Follow the installation guide for your platform

2. **Authentication errors**
   - The server will detect if you're not authenticated
   - Run `gemini auth login` to authenticate
   - Check if your credentials have expired
   - The error message will guide you on what to do

3. **File access errors**
   - Check that files are within allowed directories
   - Use absolute paths or ensure relative paths are correct
   - Set `GEMINI_MCP_ALLOWED_DIRS` for custom directories

4. **"Command not found" errors**
   - Run `gemini-mcp setup` to check your installation
   - Ensure you've installed the package: `uv pip install -e .`

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to see detailed information:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG gemini-mcp
```
